<h1> What has Stefan Sagmeister taught me about design?</h1>

<blockquote> “It is very important to embrace failure and to do a lot of stuff as much stuff as possible — with as little fear as possible.” <cite> Stefan Sagmeister. </cite>

<h2 id="early-life-and-career"> Early Life and Career </h2>
<p>
Stefan Sagmeister, an icon of graphic design, is known for his innovative and unorthodox designs. Born in Austria in 1962, it is rumored that his design career began as early as 15 when he worked for an Austrian left-wing youth magazine, Alphorn. Known to many for his early work in the music industry, sagmeister holds two Grammys for his album cover designs. His famous clients including Lou Reed, OK Go, The Rolling Stones, David Byrne, Jay Z, Aerosmith and Pat Metheny. His notable clients however do not do justice for the legacy of his work or convey the controversy he has stirred up as a result.

<blockquote> You should do everything twice. The first time you don’t know what you’re doing. The second time you do. The third time it’s boring.” <cite> Stefan Sagmeister. </cite>
  </blockquote>
<p>
After many years in industry and not being someone to stick to what he knows Sagmeister began to diversify, and he started his own creative company Sagmesiter Inc, later changing to Sagmeister&Walsh with his business partner Jessica Walsh. Many people will look at Sagmesiter’s work in a negative light as it takes a diverse approach to his designs. Often controversial and known for provocative designs this essay will explore the key points as to why Sagmesiters work is inspiring and highly regarded by my aspiring designers.

<h2 id="influences"> Influences </h2>
<p>
Sagmeister being one of the most original and innovative artists of the time it is interesting to learn who influenced him as a design student. Labelled design ‘bad boy’ Tibor Kalman of M&Co is cited at the single most influential person in Sagmesiters life and is his one and only design Hero. Sagmeister has shown his persistency and commitment from an early age as he called Kalman every week for a year and half until he agreed to meet with him eventually offering him a job at M&Co.

<blockquote>“Mr. Kalman described himself as more a social activist than a designer and constantly sought to use his work to promote causes like environmentalism and economic equality.” <cite> (New York Times, 1999). </cite>

<h2 id="his-work-and-controversy"> His Work/Controversy </h2>
<p>
Sagmeister makes it very clear that he believes in working with different mediums and against what is the norm of design. Sagmeister often demonstrates through his work pain and self-sacrifice as a designer. He created a lecture poster, AIGA Detroit 1999, in which he carved the words into his skin as he said that doing this by computer would not have had the same affect. This is only true though as two decades later the work is still as controversial and unsettling. In 2003 he created the "Sagmeister on a Binge" exhibition poster, for which he ate 100 different junk foods, gaining almost two stone in the process in only a week, and took before and after pictures of his semi-nude body. Many say that Sagmeister’s work is for media attention and promotes the wrong message for designers. However, I would disagree and defend his choices in his darker and unsettling work as it carries a strong message in a superficial driven society at what changes their opinion. Sagmeister is a talented designer that offers a lot to the industry and drives it forward, his work does not exist for the sake of being controversial.
</p>
<p>
As a designer is it important to be conscious of the struggles in the world and ne aware of those less fortunate when designing. Sagmeister has received a lot of backlash in the past for his piece “Banana Wall” (2008). Described as distasteful, a wall adorned with over 10,000 bananas at varying stages of ripeness that, for a limited time displayed the phrase “Self-confidence produces fine results” before rotting away completely, it was heavily criticized for its wastefulness. It is important for young designers to see the nerves can be struck in design and know that social responsibility is a part of design too.
</p>
<p>
Sagmeisters distinctive work has made him stand out from the crowd as he questions the orthodox. Sagmeister’s work acts as a reminder to designers to work towards creating unique pieces when possible to push the boundaries as a designer resulting in powerful and original outcomes.
